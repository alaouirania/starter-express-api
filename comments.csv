"Hi, I tried the example and there is some overlapping between the cartypes and gates barchart when resizing the window. Using the inspector I found that the div for cartypes is smaller than the associated barchart and the div for the gates is bigger than the barchart, do you know how to fix it?"
"Hi John, <br>Very good and informative video, thank you for making it and sharing your knowledge!<br>One piece of feedback to make your videos even better in the future, you move a bit fast in your code. I&#39;ve just been following along in the video and it&#39;s often I have to go back a few seconds because I didn&#39;t catch the end of what you just wrote before you jump to another place in the code. If you just do a small pause before jumping away from the code you just wrote, it would allow the viewer to pause and finish off their code.<br>I know you provide the code on Github but personally I find, I learn better if I actually follow along and type most of it myself :)<br><br>Thanks again!"
"awesome explanation .....Dude<br>Thanks a lot....!"
"Thanks great  tutorial.."
